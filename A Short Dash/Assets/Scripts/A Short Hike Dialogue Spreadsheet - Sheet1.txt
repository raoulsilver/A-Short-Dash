shopFinishedFirstLevel	dialogue	I'm finally awake! At this store you can buy a feather for 2 coins.
shopNotFinishedFirstLevel	oneline	zzzzzzz...
shopNotEnoughCoins	oneline	Sorry, you need to have 2 coins for the feather.
shopBuyFeather	oneline	2 coins! Here's a golden feather!
shopAlreadyBought	oneline	I'm all out of feathers, sorry.
bunnyoneTutorial	oneline	Continue to the right to go to the first level. You'll automatically move forward, just press the spacebar to jump. Get to the end and you'll get to another area. Use the escape key to go to the last zone
birdtwoTutorial	oneline	To play this level, you'll need a golden feather, the shopkeeper in the first zone sells them. With the feather, you can jump an extra time in the air, but you'll need to get feathers in the level to use the jump again.
birdthreeIntro	oneline	I want more books to read
birdthreeGiveBook	oneline	Thank you for the book!
foxoneBusTutorial	oneline	Move into the bus to go back to the previous level. You'll have to replay the last level though.

bunny1Tutorial	dialogue	o;hey are you going to keep going down here through the trees?;p;yeah i guess so;o;well then why not turn it into a game!;o;try jogging down the path without stopping the whole way through!;o;oh but watch out for the thornst those can hurt;o;and running right into a wall can hurt too;p;yeah i think i could have figured that one out by myself;o;oh yeah, also remember press the spacebar to jump;o;and press escape to come back here if you get too frusturated.;p;is it really that hard of a walk?;o;that just depends on your attitude
bunny1Idle	dialogue	o;oh also, a lot of people have lost a bunch of their stuff down this way, so try to pick up some of their stuff for them
bird2Tutorial	dialogue	o;woah there, are you trying to go down this trail?;p;i was thinking about it, yeah;o;well this trail is a lot more tricky than the other one to the east;o;to even think about going down it, you'll need a golden feather;o;they'll let you jump higher in the air by pressing space again;o;and keep in mind that pressing escape will make you come back here;p;oh thanks for letting me know
